# Full-Waveform-Inversion-for-Seismic-Waves
Julia implementation of pseudo-spectral time-domain methods to simulate shear-horizontal (SH) wave propagation and apply Full Waveform Inversion (FWI). Demonstrates seismic forward modeling, adjoint-state method, and inversion for medium property recovery.
